# Predicting-Customer-Subscription
Predicting Customer Subscription to Term Deposits Using the Bank  Marketing Dataset

Introduction

This project analyzes the Bank Marketing dataset to understand and predict customer subscription to term deposits. Term deposits are a critical source of stable funding for banks, making efficient and accurate customer targeting an important business problem. Using Python and a single Jupyter Notebook, this project applies descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to examine customer demographics, financial attributes, and campaign-related behaviors collected across multiple marketing campaigns.
The analysis follows an end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model development, performance evaluation, and ethical assessment. Special attention is given to handling class imbalance, preventing target leakage, and ensuring that model outputs are interpretable and operationally useful for real-world marketing decisions.

Objective

The objective of this project is to build a data-driven framework for predicting customer subscription to term deposits and translating those predictions into actionable marketing strategies. Specifically, the project aims to:
1. Clean and preprocess the Bank Marketing dataset by handling missing values, treating outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Perform descriptive analytics to identify key demographic, behavioral, and campaign-related patterns influencing subscription outcomes.
3. Develop and evaluate predictive models, with a primary focus on Logistic Regression, to estimate the likelihood of customer subscription and assess performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and accuracy.
4. Apply prescriptive analytics by segmenting customers based on predicted probabilities and recommending targeted outreach strategies to reduce marketing effort while maintaining high conversion potential.
5. Examine ethical considerations, including fairness across age groups, calibration of predicted probabilities, and responsible use of predictive models in decision-making.
6. Document challenges encountered during the analysis, justify any revisions to the original plan, and outline solutions or next steps where limitations remain.
